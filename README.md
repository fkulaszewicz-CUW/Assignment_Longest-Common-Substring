# Assignment_Longest-Common-Substring
 
Step 1: Implement an example of Longest common substring as described above.

            Your program should take in 2 strings, you can assume for this assignment that they are identical in length.

            You should create a lookup table similar to the previous slide that shows the dynamically growing table that can ultimately be used to determine an answer. 

                For example, if your input strings were “ABAB” and “BABA” your program’s output should be a 2D grid similar to what is shown in the previous slide along with the solution, which in this case is a tie between “BAB” and “ABA” since the largest value is a 3. 

Step 2: You can show just one of the winners in your solution since there is a tie in this example case. 

Step 3: You can assume that there is at least a single shared character in both strings, so you do not need to solve for the case of no matching sequence.
